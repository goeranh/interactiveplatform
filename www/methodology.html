<h2 id="HESR">The Health Equity Status Report initiative (HESRi)</h2>
<p>The WHO European Health Equity Status Report initiative (HESRi) is being developed as a mechanism to promote and support policy action and commitment for health equity and well-being in the European Region. Specifically, the HESRi aims to shift political and policy focus from describing the problem to capturing progress and enabling action to increase equity in health. The <a href="http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-determinants/social-determinants/health-equity-status-report-initiative/health-equity-status-report-2019">Health Equity Status Report (HESR)</a>, the flagship report of the HESRi, is a comprehensive review of the status and trends in health inequities and of the essential conditions needed for all to be able to live a healthy life in the WHO European Region.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="HESRdataset">The HESRi Health Equity Dataset</h2>
<p>
The analysis and findings in the HESR are generated from the new HESRi Health Equity Dataset. From this dataset a range of data analyses and visualizations can be derived to support a deeper understanding of the current status of health inequities within countries. The dataset can also be used to analyse whether there have been significant reductions or increases in these inequities over a given period. Please note that while indicator-specific year ranges were used for the trend analyses in the HESR, the online interactive platform currently does not have this functionality and the same year ranges are specified across all the indicators - the trends displayed in the online interactive platform are calculated between 2000 (or the earliest year of data available from 2000 onwards) and the most recent year of data available.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="Indicators">1. Selection of indicators</h3>
<p>
Indicators were selected for inclusion in the HESRi Health Equity Dataset to provide a pragmatic set of measures that were based on accessible data and cover health equity status and policy progress across the five underlying conditions of health equity: Health Services, Income Security and Social Protection, Living Conditions, Social and Human Capital and Employment and Working Conditions. Certain key criteria were considered in selecting indicators, in consultation with the Scientific Expert Advisory Group.<br><br>

The Health Equity Dataset aimed to include indicators that:<br><br>

• clearly related to priority areas for action on health equity for which there is a clear evidence base;<br>
• related to areas of action in which Member States have already made commitments;<br>
• were relevant to the full range of country contexts across the WHO European Region;<br>
• provided a balance of measures across the five underlying conditions for health equity;<br>
• provided sufficient coverage of countries across the Region – aiming to cover at least 30 countries with each
indicator, with preference given to indicators that covered countries outside the European Union (EU);<br>
• used data that had been collected though consistent processes across countries in order to support more
reliable comparisons;<br>
• used data that could be disaggregated by socioeconomic status, or that were related to policies known to
have an impact on health inequities;<br>
• used openly accessible data from international datasets, which could be feasibly collected and analysed given
the available timescale and resources;<br>
• used data that were reasonably current and that could be updated to track trends.<br><br>

An initial, long list of over 200 indicators was reviewed by the Scientific Expert Advisory Group and through wide
consultation against the criteria listed above; the final 108 indicators included in the Health Equity Dataset were
selected.

<h3 id="Datasources">2. Data sources</h3>
<p>
Data from several sources were used to derive the indicators featured in the Health Equity Dataset. Data were obtained from sources such as household and other population-based surveys, administrative data systems and surveillance systems. Where obtainable, publicly available data were used. For example, a number of indicators were derived from datasets containing national-level data published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), World Bank, International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Eurostat database from the Statistical Office of the EU. Eurostat data were obtained through a data-sharing agreement (RPP 85/2018-LFS-EU-SILC-EHIS).<br><br>
The responsibility for all conclusions drawn from the data lies entirely with the authors.<br><br>
Where data were not publicly available, survey microdata, which contained information available at the individual level, were used to derive indicators. Official requests were made to access survey microdata, using (for example) the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions instrument (EU-SILC), the WHO STEPwise approach to Surveillance (STEPS) tool, and the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS; included in the list below). Empirical data collected from these nationally representative surveys, among others, were compiled and processed to create indicators.<br><br>

<h3 id="Dataprocessing">3. Data processing</h3>
<p>
Following data collection, individual datasets containing primary data were stored in a secure data warehouse for processing. In order to maximize country coverage, indicators were created by combining datasets from different sources, if comparable data were available. Data processing involved, where necessary, data cleaning and suppression of implausible values and cells based on small samples (counts of <50 respondents). Data were aggregated by country and year, as well as characteristics such as sex, age group, education level and income, using survey weights where available to adjust for sampling errors and biases.<br><br>

To facilitate comparison between countries with different age profiles, health outcome indicators were directly age standardized with the WHO World Standard Population.<br><br>

For some analyses, countries were aggregated by geographical region, as follows: Caucasus, central Asia, central Europe, Nordic countries, Russia(n) (Federation), South-eastern Europe/western Balkans, southern Europe and western Europe.<br><br>

For the majority of indicators, income quintiles were calculated based on equivalized disposable household income. Where possible, levels of education were based on the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) 2011, or the earlier classification, ISCED 1997. The ISCED educational levels are often aggregated to form a three-category education variable, with: (1) low-level education, which is pre-primary to lowersecondary education only; (2) mid-level education, which represents upper-secondary to post-secondary nontertiary education; and (3) high-level education, which is tertiary education. Indicators within the HESR were disaggregated by this three-category variable for educational level, where available; otherwise, an equivalent measure was used, such as years of education.<br><br>
Data processing was conducted using R statistical software (version 3.4.3). A panel of regional experts, scientific advisors and members of international organizations approved the methods used and the interpretation of the indicators, prior to publication.
The primary equity measure derived was the absolute difference between the most and least disadvantaged groups (e.g. based on education or income). Trends were assessed as increasing if the linear trend across all the data points available was significantly greater than 0 (p<0.1), or decreasing if the linear trend across all the data points available was significantly lower than 0 (p<0.1); otherwise, the trend was labelled as having no noticeable change.<br><br>

A technical report on the microdata processing methods for deriving indicators was produced, and is available for download <a href="HESR microdata methods.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

<h3 id="Limitations">4. Limitations</h3>
<p>
Certain limitations need to be taken into account when interpreting the indicators and users should refer to the original source documentation to assess the quality of the data collection and measurement methods. Differences in methodologies – such as the extent to which samples are representative of populations – and differences in survey instruments and definitions may limit the comparisons that can be made between countries and within countries over time. Individuals from lower socioeconomic groups are often underrepresented in population-based surveys, which may limit generalizability. Additionally, self-reported outcomes may be influenced by response biases, and, when comparing countries with diverse health services, differences in selfreported health outcomes may reflect access to care, rather than real differences in morbidity.<br><br>
Whilst effort has been made to maximize country coverage, only a very small number of indicators cover all countries in the WHO European Region. This highlights the need for a coordinated approach to monitoring health equity within the Region going forward.

<h2 id="Platform">The online interactive platform</h3>
<p>
This online interactive platform for the HESRi Health Equity Dataset enables the monitoring and analysis of within-country inequities in (a) health indicators, and (b) indicators of essential underlying conditions and policies falling under five policy action areas.
It includes indicators disaggregated by sex, age, socioeconomic status, and geographical region.<br><br>

The platforms offers several different visualizations of inequities:<br><br>
<div>

<b>Gradient charts</b> are used to show the socioeconomic gradient for an indicator, such as life expectancy, by examining how levels of the indicator vary between subgroups of people. Either three or five subgroups are defined, according to markers of socioeconomic status; for example, number of years of education, or levels of income or wealth. For people belonging to each subgroup, the average level of the indicator is calculated and represented in the chart by a different coloured dot.
<br>
<img src="gradient.png">
</div>
<br>
<div>
<p>
<b>Gap charts - Difference</b> are used to show the difference in average levels of the indicator in the most advantaged subgroup compared to the most disadvantaged subgroup. For example, a chart can show the difference between those in the highest and lowest income quintiles or between those with most years of education (university level) and those with least years (lower-secondary level). The traffic light symbols in these figures also show whether the size of the gap for each country has narrowed, widened, or stayed the same over a specified time frame.
</p><br>

<br>
<div>
<p>
<b>Gap charts - Ratio</b> are used to show the ratio in average levels of the indicator in the most advantaged subgroup compared to the most disadvantaged subgroup. For example, a chart can show the ratio between those in the highest and lowest income quintiles or between those with most years of education (university level) and those with least years (lower-secondary level). The traffic light symbols in these figures also show whether the size of the ratio for each country has narrowed, widened, or stayed the same over a specified time frame.

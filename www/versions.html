<p><strong>HESRi Health Equity Dataset - September 2019 - Version 1.1 </strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Added redirect key to Compare Inquities from home page</li>
	<li>Compare Inequities - Disaggregated Data:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Added drop-down menu as category filter (from metadata section - xlsx source file);</li>
		<li>Added drop-down menu as filter by indicator (from metadata section - xlsx source file) - intervention outside standard HEAT+ naive</li>
		<li>Conditionally to the filters (e.g. Health indicator), the Select Inequities dimension parameter allows the exclusive selection of the available dimensions for the higher grade indicator</li>
		<li>Removed filter by WHO Region</li>
		<li>Modified the order of the selector:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Select indicator category</li>
			<li>Select indicator </li>
			<li>Select stratifier (previouslt labeled "Select inequity dimension")</li>
			<li>Select year</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Compare Inequities - Summary measures:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Removed Select setting and Select comparison settings</li>
		<li>Modified the order of the selectors (see above)</li>
	</ul>
	<li>In Metadata: added drop-down of selection categories/indicators equal to the selection of the indicator in the compare inequities.</li>

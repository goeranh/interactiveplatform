<h3><a id="1. Introduction" name="1. Introduction"></a>1. Introduction</h3>

<p>The Health Equity Assessment Toolkit Plus (HEAT Plus) enables the assessment of within-country inequalities, i.e. inequalities that exist between population subgroups within a country, based on disaggregated data and summary measures of inequality. Disaggregated data show the level of health by population subgroup of a given dimension of inequality. Summary measures build on disaggregated data and present the degree of inequality across multiple population subgroups in a single numerical figure. These technical notes provide information about disaggregated data in general (section 2) and detailed information about the summary measures calculated in HEAT Plus (section 3).</p>

<h3><a id="2. Disaggregated data" name="2. Disaggregated data"></a>2. Disaggregated data</h3>

<p>Assessing within-country health inequalities requires the use of health data that are disaggregated according to relevant dimensions of inequality (i.e. demographic, socio-economic, or geographical factors). Disaggregated data break down overall averages, revealing differences in health indicators between different population subgroups. This is essential for the development of equity-oriented interventions, especially those on the path to universal health coverage, serving as the basis for the design and re-orientation of rights-based, gender-responsive and equitable health systems.</p>

<p>Two types of data are required calculating disaggregated data: data about &ldquo;health indicators&rdquo; that describe an individual&rsquo;s experience of health and data about &ldquo;dimensions of inequality&rdquo; that allow populations to be organized into subgroups according to their demographic, geographic and/or socioeconomic characteristics.</p>

<p>The following two sections provide more information about the different types and characteristics of health indicators and dimensions of inequality. Further information about disaggregated data can be found in the <em>Handbook on health inequality monitoring: with a special focus on low- and middle-income countries</em>. <a href="#Footnote 1">[1]</a> </p>

<h3><a id="2.1 Health indicators" name="2.1 Health indicators"></a>2.1 Health indicators</h3>

<p>There are different types of health indicators, that may be reported at different scales. Differentiating between the different types and scales is important as these characteristics have implications for the calculation of summary measures (see section 3).</p>

<p>Health indicators can be divided into favourable and adverse health indicators. <strong>Favourable health indicators</strong> measure desirable health events that are promoted through public health action. They include health intervention indicators, such as antenatal care coverage, and desirable health outcome indicators, such as life expectancy. For these indicators, the ultimate goal is to achieve a maximum level, either in health intervention coverage or health outcome (for example, complete coverage of antenatal care or the highest possible life expectancy). <strong>Adverse health indicators</strong>, on the other hand, measure undesirable events, that are to be reduced or eliminated through public health action. They include undesirable health outcome indicators, such as stunting prevalence in children aged less than five years or under-five mortality rate. Here, the ultimate goal is to achieve a minimum level in health outcome (for example, a stunting prevalence or mortality rate of zero).</p>

<p>Furthermore, health indicators can be reported at different <strong>indicator scales</strong>. For example, while total fertility rate is usually reported as the number of children <em>per woman</em> (indicator scale = 1), coverage of skilled birth attendance is reported as a <em>percentage</em> (indicator scale = 100) and neonatal mortality rate is reported as the number of deaths <em>per 1000 live births</em> (indicator scale = 1000).</p>

<h3><a id="2.2 Stratifier" name="2.2 Stratifier"></a>2.2 Stratifier</h3>

<p>Similarly to health indicators, there are different types of dimensions of inequality with different characteristics. It is important to take these characteristics into account as they have implications for the calculation of summary measures, too (section 3).</p>

<p>At the most basic level, dimensions of inequality can be divided into <strong>binary dimensions</strong>, i.e. dimensions that compare the situation in two population subgroups (e.g. males and females), versus dimensions that look at the situation in more than two population subgroups (e.g. economic status quintiles).</p>

<p>In the case of dimensions with more than two population subgroups it is possible to differentiate between dimensions with ordered subgroups and non-ordered subgroups. <strong>Ordered dimensions</strong> have subgroups with an inherent positioning that can be ranked. For example, education has an inherent ordering of subgroups in the sense that those with less education unequivocally have <em>less</em> of something compared to those with more education. <strong>Non-ordered dimensions</strong>, by contrast, have subgroups that are not based on criteria that can be logically ranked. Subnational regions are an example of non-ordered groupings.</p>

<p>For ordered dimensions, subgroups can be ranked from the most-disadvantaged to the most-advantaged subgroup. The <strong>subgroup order</strong> defines the rank of each subgroup. For example, if education is categorized in three subgroups (no education, primary school, and secondary school or higher), then subgroups may be ranked from no education (subgroup order = 1) to secondary school or higher (subgroup order = 3).</p>

<p>For non-ordered dimensions, while it is not possible to rank subgroups, it is possible to identify a <strong>reference subgroup</strong>, that serves as a benchmark. For example, for subnational regions, the region with the capital city may be selected as the reference subgroup in order to compare the situation in all other regions with the situation in the capital city.</p>

<h3><a id="3. Summary measures" name="3. Summary measures"></a>3. Summary measures</h3>

<p>Summary measures are calculated based on disaggregated data, combining estimates of a given health indicator for two or more subgroups into a single numerical figure.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#Top2" style="text-align: right;">Back to top</a></p>

<h3><a id="3.1 Difference" name="3.1 Difference"></a>3.1 Difference</h3>

<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>

<p>The difference (D) is a simple, unweighted measure of inequality that shows the absolute inequality between two subgroups.</p>

<p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>

<p>D is calculated as the difference between two subgroups. For ordered dimensions, the most-advantaged and most-disadvantaged subgroups are compared. For non-ordered and binary dimensions, either a selected reference subgroup is compared with another subgroup or, if no reference subgroup has been selected, the two subgroups with the highest and lowest estimates are used:</p>

<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D = y<sub>high</sub> - y<sub>low</sub>.</p>

<p>Note that the selection of y<sub>high</sub> and y<sub>low</sub> depends on the type of indicator and on the characteristics of the dimension of inequality, for which D is calculated. 
For ordered dimensions, y<sub>high</sub> refers to the most-advantaged subgroup and y<sub>low</sub> to the most disadvantaged subgroup in the case of favourable indicators, and vice versa in the case of adverse indicators.
For non-ordered and binary dimensions, for which a reference subgroup has been selected, y<sub>high</sub> refers to the selected reference subgroup and y<sub>low</sub> to the subgroup that maximizes the absolute difference in the case of favourable indicators, and vice versa in the case of adverse indicators.
For non-ordered and binary dimensions without a selected reference subgroup, the lowest estimate is subtracted from the highest estimate, regardless of the indicator type.</p>

<p>D is calculated for all dimensions of inequality. In the case of ordered dimensions, D is missing if the estimates for the most-advantaged and/or most-disadvantaged subgroup are missing. In the case of non-ordered and binary dimensions, D is missing if at least one subgroup estimate is missing.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>

<p>If there is no inequality, D takes the value zero. Greater absolute values indicate higher levels of inequality. For favourable indicators, positive values indicate a higher concentration of the indicator among the advantaged subgroups and negative values indicate a higher concentration among the disadvantaged subgroups. For adverse indicators, positive values indicate a higher concentration of the indicator among the disadvantaged and negative values indicate a higher concentration among the advantaged.</p>

<p><strong>Other calculations</strong></p>

<p>For non-ordered dimensions with more than 30 subgroups, additional difference measures are calculated, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Difference between percentile 80 and percentile 20,</li>
	<li>Difference between the mean estimates in quintile 5 and quintile 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, for non-ordered dimensions with more than 60 subgroups, the following difference measures are calculated:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Difference between percentile 90 and percentile 10,</li>
	<li>Difference between the mean estimates in decile 10 and decile 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, for non-ordered dimensions with more than 100 subgroups, the following difference measures are also calculated:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Difference between percentile 95 and percentile 5,</li>
	<li>Difference between the mean estimates in the top 5% and the bottom 5%.</li>
</ul>
<p>These measures are displayed in the <em>Explore Inequality – Disaggregated data (detailed bar graphs)</em> tab, provided a non-ordered dimension with at least 30 subgroups has been selected.</p>

<h3><a id="3.2 Ratio" name="3.2 Ratio"></a>3.2 Ratio</h3>

<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>

<p>The ratio (R) is a simple, unweighted measure of inequality that shows the relative inequality between two subgroups.</p>

<p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>

<p>R is calculated as the ratio of two subgroups. For ordered dimensions, the most-advantaged and most-disadvantaged subgroups are compared. For non-ordered and binary dimensions, either a selected reference subgroup is compared with another subgroup or, if no reference subgroup has been selected, the two subgroups with the highest and lowest estimates are used:</p>

<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R = y<sub>high</sub> / y<sub>low</sub>.</p>

<p>Note that the selection of y<sub>high</sub> and y<sub>low</sub> depends on the type of indicator and on the characteristics of the dimension of inequality, for which R is calculated.
For ordered dimensions, y<sub>high</sub> refers to the most-advantaged subgroup and y<sub>low</sub> to the most-disadvantaged subgroup in the case of favourable indicators, and vice versa in the case of adverse indicators.
For non-ordered and binary dimensions, for which a reference subgroup has been selected, y<sub>high</sub> refers to the selected reference subgroup and y<sub>low</sub> to the subgroup that maximizes the ratio in the case of favourable indicators, and vice versa in the case of adverse indicators.
For non-ordered and binary dimensions without a selected reference subgroup, the highest estimate is divided by the lowest estimate, regardless of the indicator type.</p>

<p>R is calculated for all dimensions of inequality. In the case of ordered dimensions, R is missing if the estimates for the most-advantaged and/or most-disadvantaged subgroup are missing. In the case of non-ordered and binary dimensions, R is missing if at least one subgroup estimate is missing. </p>

<p><strong>Interpretation</strong></p>

<p>If there is no inequality, R takes the value one. It takes only positive values (larger or smaller than 1). The further the value of R from 1, the higher the level of inequality.</p>

<p><strong>Other calculations</strong></p>

<p>For non-ordered dimensions with more than 30 subgroups, additional ratio measures are calculated, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ratio of percentile 80 to percentile 20,</li>
	<li>Ratio of the mean estimates in quintile 5 to quintile 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, for non-ordered dimensions with more than 60 subgroups, additional ratio measures are calculated, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ratio of percentile 90 to percentile 10,</li>
	<li>Ratio of the mean estimates in decile 10 to decile 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, for non-ordered dimensions with more than 100 subgroups, the following ratio measures are also calculated:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Ratio of percentile 95 to percentile 5,</li>
	<li>Ratio of the mean estimates in the top 5% to the bottom 5%.</li>
</ul>
<p>These measures are displayed in the <em>Explore Inequality – Disaggregated data (detailed bar graphs)</em> tab, provided a non-ordered dimension with at least 30 subgroups has been selected.</p>
